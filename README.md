# Exploratory Data Analysis in the Hospitality Industry

This project involves analyzing datasets from the hospitality domain to uncover insights into booking behaviors, platform usage, revenue patterns, and room occupancy. The analysis is presented in a Jupyter Notebook and includes comprehensive data cleaning, transformation, and visualization steps.

---

## Project Overview

### Goals
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns in customer behavior and business performance.
- Analyze booking platform performance, revenue contributions, and room utilization rates.
- Visualize insights to aid in decision-making for the hospitality industry.

## Key Features

### Data Overview
The analysis is based on the following datasets:
- **`dim_date.csv`**: Date dimensions with time-related information.
- **`dim_hotels.csv`**: Details of hotels and their properties.
- **`dim_rooms.csv`**: Room category and capacity details.
- **`fact_aggregated_bookings.csv`**: Aggregated booking data.
- **`fact_bookings.csv`**: Detailed transactional booking records.

### Highlights of the Analysis
1. **Booking Platform Analysis**:
   - Explored the distribution of bookings across platforms (e.g., MakeYourTrip, Direct Online).
   - Created bar charts showing the popularity of booking platforms.

2. **Occupancy and Room Utilization**:
   - Added a calculated field to determine occupancy percentage for each room type.
   - Visualized occupancy trends across various room categories.

3. **Revenue Analysis**:
   - Grouped data by property and booking platforms to calculate revenue contributions.
   - Created a pie chart to visualize revenue contributions by booking platform.

4. **Customer Ratings**:
   - Analyzed average customer ratings for each city.
   - Identified cities with the highest guest satisfaction.

5. **Time Series Revenue Trends**:
   - Explored revenue trends over months to observe seasonality or patterns in booking revenue.

## Visualizations

The project uses visualizations to support insights, including:
- **Bar Plots**: Distribution of booking platforms.
- **Pie Charts**: Revenue contribution per booking platform.
- **Summary Tables**: Aggregated revenue, ratings, and occupancy rates.
